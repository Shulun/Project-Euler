# Project-Euler
Here I provide some of my solutions to Project Euler problems in MATLAB. Most solutions are tested to make sure the runtime is less than 1-2 seconds. Rest of the solutions will have their execution times listed in the commit message. Please let me know if you know any other more efficient methods to solve those problems or anything I could improve in my codes. Thank you!
